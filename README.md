California Housing Price Prediction
========================

##Project

The purpose of the project is to predict median house values in Californian districts, given many features from these districts.
The project also aims at building a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. The data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
